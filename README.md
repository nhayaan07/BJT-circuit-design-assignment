# BJT-circuit-design-assignment


In this assignment, I designed and analyzed two circuits: a BJT amplifier and a relay module.

Problem 1: BJT Amplifier Design
I determined the assigned BJT  BC548 based on my student ID.
I referred to the datasheet to find a suitable operating point.
I designed a voltage divider bias circuit to achieve the operating point.
I calculated input impedance, output impedance, and voltage gain.
I simulated the circuit in TINA-TI, applied a sinusoidal input signal, and plotted input-output waveforms.
Finally, I compared the theoretical and simulated gain values.
Problem 2: Relay Module Design
I designed a relay module circuit using SRD-05VDC-SL-C (5V)  based on my student ID.
I identified and defined the BJT and diode used in the circuit.
I created a hand-drawn schematic with labeled component values.
I performed and documented hand calculations for the circuit.
All necessary calculations, circuit diagrams, and simulation files were included in the final submission.
